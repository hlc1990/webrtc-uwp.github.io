# WebRTC for the Universal Windows Platform

This is the central point for documentaion for WebRTC on UWP.  Here you can find pointers to samples, links to the complete SDK and development how-tos.

Some repositories which can be cloned independently have `readme.md` files that list basic requirements.  In general those repositories link back to this site for more detailed information.

Please submit any documentation issues or requests to this repository.

## Current Status

## Known Issues

- ARM is currently unsupported (but under development).  For ARM support, use M54 or earlier releases.
- Audio device selection was removed from the Google WebRTC APIs, and is therefore no longer supported here.  Playback occurs on the default device as specified by Windows.
